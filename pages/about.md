#### Kenya
Kenya is a land of dreams and dreamers.  A country of pastorialists living as they did centuries ago while one of the biggest cities in Africa explodes with life just a few kilometres away.
In Kenya, there are lions in the city and hippos in the lakes and whales in the sea.  In Kenya, you can safari, shop and swim in the Indian Ocean within the same day.
As hard as we try we will never be able to convey the sheer majesty of a country that is blessed with amazing people, volcanoes and rifts and lakes and wildlife that are beyond your imagination.
