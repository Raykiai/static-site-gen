__Mexican Food In Westlands__

I have since been to Mercado Mexican restaurant in Nairobi and the food was significantly better. Not earth shaking but a definite improvement on the last visit. The cocktails were lush, but man oh man was it pricey. Incidentally the Blue Door nightclub opposite is fabulous. 
Mercado, Mercado. I wanted to love you. I wanted to rave about you. At one point last night I was composing eloquent Mexican love poems to you. Then I tasted your food. Top marks for presentation, struggling above midway for the food.

***Warm and inviting decor***

Sleekly authentic with a modern twist would capture it. Raw wood beams line the spacious room. Warm lighting and murmured conversations vie with authentic smells. I am ushered in beyond the bank of terrariums and vintage filament lamps, to a space chaperoned by an expansive bar. Mexican tiles on the walls mimic the authentic table wear. Tables have a unique twist with riotously coloured furnishings and benches suspended from the ceiling. There is an outside area for cocktails and stargazing, another area for reclining with coffee. It felt like the kind of place you could hang out all day. Indeed, they serve breakfast so you probably can.

__Average food__

The food wasn’t bad it was just lacklustre in comparison to the rest of the package. Guacamole lacked seasoning, lime and coriander. Halloumi fries were overcooked. The quesadilla was amongst the saddest I’ve ever seen; a mere scraping of beans and cheese making the most miserly Mexican sandwich.
They just tasted like friend mushrooms with beans and a cheese topping. The flavours of garlic and chilli were lacking. The presentation of hubbys burritos was poor. It was a small wrap filled with pulled pork that had been liberally bulked up with rice and peas. It came served with three miniscule pots of salsa and guacamole.

In short the whole menu lacked depth of flavour and pizzazz. This was Mexican I could have cooked at home and it felt rushed and poorly thought through.
