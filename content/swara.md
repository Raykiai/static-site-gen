If you are searching for a safari-style camp within an hour of Nairobi city, then Swara Acacia Lodge is your answer. Perched in a sweet spot on the Athi Plains, Swara offers family-friendly, safari fun at a fraction of the price you usually pay for a weekend break from Nairobi.

Swara Acacia Lodge Athi River is set in the Kapiti grasslands, on the Swara/Athi Plains, within a 20,000-acre private wildlife conservancy. On our arrival in mid-January, the plains stretched to the horizon, and the summer sun had burned the grasses to caramel and ash. Yellow acacia trees offered the animals little shelter and the occasional dam was spotted with footprints from antelope, zebra, giraffe and hyena. The plains shimmered with heat that only the colours of superb starlings, yellow-necked giraffes or the white bottoms of impala broke up.

Swara Acacia Lodge appears in a forest of mustard dipped acacia trees. A Makuti roofed reception greets us with its small shop and cooling drinks. Through the other side, banda’s circled a grassy area with replete with climbing frames and swings. A quick wander around the Nairobi lodge revealed a swimming pool, dartboard, pool and Ping-Pong tables. Small ponds filled with catfish and frogs twinkled through islands of foliage. As the children leap on their bikes and charge around the paths that meander through the lodge, the adults are drawn inexorably towards the fully stocked bar and promise of cold rose.

As night falls, we eat our second meal of the day. Lunch was a la carte; I had whole baked tilapia with a sweet smoky tomato sauce, my friends ate curry and lamb tagine whilst the children feasted on chicken escalope. In the evening the food was buffet style, nyama choma, with all the sides or burgers made to order, and for breakfast we had continental options alongside a buffet of cooked food. It’s good home cooking. more enjoyed by some than others. The black forest gateaux was the finest I’ve eaten but the Nyama Choma a little tough. Service was endearingly friendly but a little inefficient: tea took 20 minutes, eggs never appeared.

At night we sat by the sunken firepit and listen to the hyenas call to each other and a zebra yips in distress. We gaze into the flames or up at the stars, sup Amarula and feel a million miles away from Nairobi.
In the morning the Ngong Hills that signal home to me are clearly visible, we aren’t so far from home after all. It’s Nairobi but it doesn’t feel like it, perhaps it’s the Nairobi of yesteryear, before the buildings and the traffic and the chaos.
