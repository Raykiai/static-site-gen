__An Afternoon with - Tea Tasting Experience__

First up I had a green tea. I am not a fan of green tea at all. It is my natural aversion to bitterness as a flavour. But I get it. I have a theory that it is a part of natureâ€™s way of preserving life. I am naturally a low low blood pressure person so anything that could reduce it is something I should have sparingly. Having said that it was mildly flavoured and easy to sip.

I have got to give it to Chef Sophia. The food was simple, beautifully presented, and ticked all the current kinds of vegan or gluten-free boxes you could ask for.

We had Swahili Oolong tea paired with butternut tea scones with an orange glaze and black sesame seeds. A side of a dollop or two of coffee leaf matcha cream was served as well.

***Rwanda Noir with Eggplant Caviar Sandwich***

That sandwich was a work of art. It was made with gluten-free bread. It was both beautiful to look at and to eat. Muthaiga Tea paired it with Rwanda Noir, a black tea with star anise and licorice notes. Why Rwanda Noir? You guessed right!
