__Breakfast Of Champions At Boho__

I went for breakfast today at one of my favourite places to eat in Karen Perhaps in all of Kenya. 

***Beautiful location, beautiful building, gorgeous, healthy, organic, sustainable food menu***

Set in the grounds of Ngong House at the end of Ndovu Road. It keeps good company with Upepo . A photographic gallery and Penny Winters outlet store, both of which are worth a mooch around after you’ve eaten. When we went it was raining, isn’t it always raining at the moment? And so I expected another meal in a dark and chilly room I was wrong. The rustic style building opens to a cosy room decorated in a simple but stylish manner. Antique rugs usher you in across flagstone flooring. Floor to ceiling conservatory windows are elegantly paired with scrubbed wooden tables and trailing plants. It was light and airy, warm and comfortable and populated with staff who were available yet unobtrusive and who made us feel very welcome.

I’ve been here for lunch a couple of times but I’m one of those sad people who once they have a dish at a restaurant they love they can’t bring themselves to choose anything else So every time I come I choose the black bean tacos.My husband is quite partial to the pulled beef burger. With Boho Iâ€™m yet to see a dish that isn’t creatively gorgeous looking and steeped in umami. Their chef deserves a medal. Boho should be better known than it is, its food is certainly some of the best I’ve had in Nairobi. I think its location in out-of-the-way Langata stops the crowds from coming in droves. Iâ€™m torn between hoping it stays that way and feeling that the people running Boho should get the recognition that they deserve
