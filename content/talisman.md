__Back story__

The Talisman Restaurant Nairobi was the first restaurant I ever visited in Kenya. Fresh from the city lights of London and the serene seaside views of Cape Town, I didn’t have many expectations for a semi-rural retreat in leafy Karen. I was wrong. The Talisman instantly became and remains, one of my favourite restaurants in the world.

Awards and accolades are heaped as high as the piles of mushroom risotto the servers carry across the candlelit terrace.

The food is extravagant, the wine list exemplary, but it’s the warm cocoon of familiarity and the guarantee of excellent service that has made this the most popular place in town for the last 10 years

__Food at The Talisman Nairobi__
Many of the ingredients are sourced from their voluptuous vegetable garden and local suppliers. A few firm favourites remain on the menu at all times, but frequent Talisman visitors are delighted by an ever-changing specials menu that features cuisine from all over the globe.

Choose from slow-cooked beef cheek, succulent pork belly, bao buns with sesame pulled beef and green onions, Poke bowls, Zanibarian seafood soup, the infamous Nyati wings, line-caught Lamu snapper or twice-cooked sticky duck legs on the permanent menu. They are all as good as they sound. The octopus carpaccio with almonds, pickled pepper and chile is amazing and the and fillet steak served with potato bhaji, charred kale and mustard and hollandaise mash is the best in Kenya by far. There is a permanent sushi menu to rival any of the Japanese restaurants in town.
