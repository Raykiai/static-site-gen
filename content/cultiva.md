__Cultiva Restaurant Nairobi__

Cultiva is a pop up on an organic farm in Langata. I’d call it rustic fine dining. The food is fine dining, the venue farmyard chic. Yesterday, Cultiva was filled with fresh roses from the farm They twirled round pillars and filled the bar whilst fairy light twinkled in in the sky. It was impossibly romantically beautiful. The restaurant space is nestled between two shipping containers that act as kitchens. The main kitchen a huge open workspace where you can watch the chefs make dreams come true. On the other side of the room is a vast open bar, made of chunky wood and backed by exposed brick walls. The furniture made of converted barrels sits around high tables, decorated with baobab pods and candles.

__Beautifully presented, flavorful food__

For main I choose tuna tartar – served on globes of potato and decorated with micro herbs and little purple flowers. The tuna is delicately flavoured and scattered with ripe avocado. My friend has the octopus with a hollandaise foam. Potatoes are crunchy, the foam an epheremal delight. The star of the show is undoubtedly the pork ribs. Cooked sous vide for three days, they melt off the bone and are a smokey sticky delight.
