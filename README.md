# static-site-gen
This is a static site generator that can take folders containing Markdown pages to produce the web pages for the grubhub website. It has support for the home page, about page, contact page, and articles page.

- I primarily chose to code this project in Python because I'm more comfortable with the programming language. 
- Note that no framework was used in the making of this project.

#### Languages Used:
+ Python 
+ JavaScript 
+ PHP 
+ CSS  
+ HTML 
+ SCSS

## Installing and running the project
1. cd into the project directory using your command prompt.

2. Ensure that you activate the virtual environment using the following command:
```
env\scripts\activate.bat
```
3. Ensure that you have markdown2, the Markdown parser, and jinja2, the web template engine for the Python programming language, installed.
Use the following command to install them:
```
pip install jinja2 markdown2

```
4. Next run the project using:
```
python main.py

```
5. Next, go to the project folder and open the folder called output. 
Here you will find the img folder and some HTML files which have been generated by the static site generator. 
Click any of these HTML files to view the generated website on your browser.
